**Steps to Create a Bookmarklet:**

1. In your web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari), open the Bookmarks bar:

2. Create a new bookmark:

Right-click on the bookmarks bar and select "Add Page" or "Add Bookmark."

3. Enter a name:

In the name field, type the name you want for the bookmarklet (e.g., "My Bookmarklet").

4. Add JavaScript code:

In the URL field, instead of a regular URL, type or paste your JavaScript code from any of the files above.

5. Save the bookmark:

Click "Save" to add the bookmarklet to your bookmarks bar.

6. Use your bookmarklet:

Just click on the bookmarklet in the bookmarks bar, and it will run the JavaScript code.
