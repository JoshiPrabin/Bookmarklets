# Steps to Create a Bookmarklet:

- In your web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari), open the Bookmarks bar: If it's not visible, press Ctrl+Shift+B (or Cmd+Shift+B on Mac) to show the bookmarks bar.

- Create a new bookmark: Right-click on the bookmarks bar and select "Add Page" or "Add Bookmark."

- Enter a name: In the name field, type the name you want for the bookmarklet (e.g., "My Bookmarklet").

- Add JavaScript code: In the URL field, instead of a regular URL, type or paste your JavaScript code from any of the files above.

- Save the bookmark: Click "Save" to add the bookmarklet to your bookmarks bar.

- Use your bookmarklet: Just click on the bookmarklet in the bookmarks bar, and it will run the JavaScript code.
